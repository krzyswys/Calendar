# TODO: connect to React
# FIXME: calculate_efficiency_of_task, calculate_efficiency_with_priority_of_task account for subtask (and task occurences?)
# TODO: split views into static html and REST views

# NOTE: in order to change existing repeating parent previous task occurences must be deleted first
# NOTE: parent task cant be removed
# NOTE: do not allow to change occurence category
# NOTE: timezone support is off
# NOTE: consider if event/task could be 'abstract' and only occurences would be shown, then statistics could operate only on task/event_occurences
