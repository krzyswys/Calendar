Efficiency in relation to priority level for each task
Efficiency without considering priority level for each task
Number of tasks completed on time with a given priority
Number of tasks completed within the slide time with a given priority
Total number of tasks completed on time before the deadline
Total number of tasks completed within the slide time
Number of tasks completed up to the expected completion
Check what percentage of tasks in a given category is completed within different timeframes (until now / overall) (deadline, slide, expected completion)
Average delay for tasks in a specific category concerning different timeframes (deadline, slide, expected completion)
Average delay for tasks at a specific priority level concerning different timeframes (deadline, slide, expected completion)
Amount of time tasks from a specific category take
Amount of time tasks at a specific priority level take
Total time taken by events from a specific category
Percentage of events in a specific location
Percentage of events with a particular priority level

Subtasks:

Total time spent on a task + its subtasks
Percentage of task completion, including its subtasks (100 * number of completed subtasks / total number of subtasks)
Task + its subtasks - how many were completed within the expected time, how many within the expected time plus a delay, how many before the deadline, how many after the deadline
Average time between completing subtasks and their expected completion date
Average time between completing subtasks and their expected completion date + delay (if completed after the expected date)
Average time between completing subtasks and their deadline (if not completed by the expected date + delay)
Average time between the deadline and completing subtasks (if completed after the deadline)
